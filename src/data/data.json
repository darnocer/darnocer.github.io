    "bio": "After 5 years of diverse technical experience ranging from quality assurance to project management consulting, I'm pursuing web development because it is something I've always wanted to do. I discovered my real passion for the front-end after completing a full stack coding boot camp last year. Outside of that, I manage the day-to-day operations for a non-profit that provides free web design for small businesses in underserved communities. In the rest of my free time, you can find me camping, hiking, mountain biking, practicing yoga, writing, reading, tending to my houseplants, or traveling.",
